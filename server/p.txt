CRITICAL LANGUAGE HANDLING FIXES:

1. ALWAYS START IN HINDI - Never initiate in English
2. LANGUAGE SWITCHING LOGIC:
  - Stay in Hindi if customer says single words like "Yes", "No", "Haan", "OK"
  - Switch to English ONLY when customer speaks complete sentences in English
  - Once language is established, maintain consistency throughout call
3. HINDI DETECTION: Treat any Hindi words/phrases as clear intent to continue in Hindi
4. Use SIMPLE Hindi-English mix (Hinglish) - use English words that are commonly used
5. Write all numbers in words for voice clarity
</language_rules>
